### Challenge: job descriptions that map to appropriate salaries

.pull-left[
> A common listing describes a unicorn...

> These types of job descriptions usually mean the company doesn’t know what they’re looking for, and they expect a data scientist to come and solve all their problems without any support.

---

### The job description to offer pipeline

--

Hiring manager writes a job description
* States the primary purpose, expected deliverables
* Requirements for technical skills, prior experience, and/or education

--

HR classifies the role
* Hourly or salary
* Type of contributor: technician, professional, scientist
* Level of contributor: entry, intermediate, senior, principal

--

Role-specific salary benchmarking data are from purchased compensation surveys
* HR will aggregate across several such sources to derive a salary range
* The ultimate offer varies somewhat by company's compensation philosophy

### Concluding remarks

--

* Primary drivers of salary estimates are experience and autonomy

   + These drivers may evolve in the data science domain
   + Corollary: You probably don't need to learn fancy new language X to get the job you want
  
--

* Salary surveys are not yet capturing specific data science roles
   + E.g. machine learning engineer, decision scientist

--

* This talk is not arguing for or against the current process
   + Instead, it reports the pipeline that is common to large organizations to:
      + Empower you, the unicoRn, to capture the compensation you deserve
      + Empower managers to recruit and compensate the unicoRns they need
