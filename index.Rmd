### Challenge: job descriptions that map to appropriate salaries

.pull-left[
> A common listing describes a unicorn...

> These types of job descriptions usually mean the company doesn’t know what they’re looking for, and they expect a data scientist to come and solve all their problems without any support.

### The job description to offer pipeline

Hiring manager writes a job description
* States the primary purpose, expected deliverables
* Requirements for technical skills, prior experience, and/or education

--

HR benchmarks a market price using the following criteria
* Hourly or salary
* Type of contributor: technician, professional, scientist
* Level of contributor: entry, intermediate, senior, principal

--

Benchmarking data are from purchased compensation surveys that require licensure
* HR will aggregate across several such sources to derive a salary range
* The ultimate offer varies somewhat by company's compensation philosophy
